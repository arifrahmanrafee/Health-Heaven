			<h2>Scientic name : Caesalpinia pulcherrima </h2> 
			<p>C. pulcherrima of the family Fabaceae or Leguminosae is locally known as ‘krishnachura’ in Bangladesh
        and as ‘peacock ower’ worldwide. Various medicinally active vegetative sections of this plant including 
        young leaves, bark, fruit, seed, stem, ower, and whole plant are considered as a storehouse of di erent 
        bioactive compounds such as sterols (e.g., β-sitosterol), avonoids (e.g., avones, iso avones, avanols 
        chalcones, rotenoids), glycosides, organic compounds (e.g., α-phellandrene), essential oils (e.g., βcaryophyllene, γ-Terpinene), and carotenoids (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin), etc. Traditionally, the 
        extracts of this plant have been used to treat various diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, dysentery, fungal 
        infections, respiratory diseases, in ammatory diseases, and microbial diseases. The gastropro-tective 
        ability of galactomannan extracted from the seeds of C. pulcherrima L. (GM- CP) was assessed in 
        indomethacin induced acute gastritis model, which showed that GM-CP (10 mg/kg dose) decreased the 
        severity of macroscopic lesion as well as the loss of super cial cells through ameliorating in ammatory 
        symptoms including neutrophil in ltration, production of TNF-α, thiobarbituric acid, reactive species 
        migration, and adhesion of mesenteric leukocytes. Sharma and Rajani have assessed the anti-in ammatory and anti-ulcer e cacy of C. pulcherrima in indomethacin induced cotton pellet granuloma and both 
        aspirin and pylorus-ligation-induced ulcer models respectively [134].in at a concentration of 0-1
        mg/kg body weight per day had no adverse health e ects on the human body.g.
