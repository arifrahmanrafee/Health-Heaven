			<h2>Scientic name : Hibiscus rosa-sinensis  </h2> 
			<p>H. rosa-sinensis (family: Malvaceae) is locally known as ‘joba’ in Bangladesh and commonly 
        known as ‘China rose’ worldwide. The root, leaf, and ower of H. rosa-sinensis contains different 
        active constit-uents such as tannins, steroids, anthraquinones, essential oils, quinines, 
        mucilage, phenols, reducing sugars, avonoids, carbohydrates, free amino acids, alkaloids, 
        proteins, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, and saponins. Traditionally, the root of the plant is 
        used for treating ulcers. The administration of aque-ous ower extract from this plant (250 mg/kg) 
        revealed gastric ulcer suppressive activity against pylo-rus-ligation, aspirin-induced, and ethanolinduced ulcers in vivo and this protective activity occurred due to the presence of avonoids and 
        tannins as free radical quenchers . Fruits are used externally to cure sprains, wounds, and ulcers. </p>
