			<h2>Scientic name : Ocimum tenuiflorum </h2> 
			<p>Ocimum tenuiflorum, commonly known as holy basil or tulsi, is an aromatic perennial 
        plant in the family Lamiaceae. Tulsi can address physical, chemical, metabolic and 
        psychological stress through a unique combination of pharmacological actions. Tulsi 
        has been found to protect organs and tissues against chemical stress from industrial 
        pollutants and heavy metals, and physical stress from prolonged physical exertion, 
        ischemia, physical restraint and exposure to cold and excessive noise. Tulsi has also 
        been shown to counter metabolic stress through normalization of blood glucose, 
        blood pressure and lipid levels, and psychological stress through positive effects on 
        memory and cognitive function and through its anxiolytic and anti-depressant 
        properties. Tulsi's broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes activity 
        against a range of human and animal pathogens, suggests it can be used as a hand 
        sanitizer, mouthwash and water purifier as well as in animal rearing, wound healing, 
        the preservation of food stuffs and herbal raw materials and traveler's health. </p>
