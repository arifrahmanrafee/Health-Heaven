			<h2>Scientic name :Trigonella foenum-graecum  </h2> 
			<p>Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum Linn) is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family. Nearly 175 compounds have been identified in fenugreek seeds. Fenugreek contains active constituents such as steroid saponin compounds, fibers, phenolic acid compounds, protodioscin, flavonoids, hydrocarbons, alkaloids, terpenes, fatty acids glycosides, carbohydrates, amino acids, and their derivatives.
      The genus Trigonella, “little triangle” in Latin, is named after the triangular flowers. It is among the most promising traditional plants, cultivated widely in many parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia as an indigenous medicine, spice, and herbal food. The seeds and leaves of fenugreek are formulated in powder and extract forms for medical purposes.A broad spectrum of systematic reviews and scientific data demonstrated that fenugreek and its extracts improve glycemic and lipid profile. Fenugreek is known to have antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunological, antiobesity, and hepatoprotective effects, and are beneficial to women’s health. Further, previous studies reported that fenugreek improved cognitive functions and Parkinson’s symptoms and showed antianxiety, antidepressant, and neuroprotective properties. A recent study has reported the beneficial effects of fenugreek and its extract on hormonal-related statuses, such as galactagogue in lactating women and male impotence.
