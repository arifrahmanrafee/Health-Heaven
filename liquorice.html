			<h2>Scientific name: Glycyrrhiza glabra </h2> 
			<p>G. glabra (family: Fabaceae) has been reported to treat gastric ulcers, oral ulcers, as 
                well as ulcerative colitis. Although the powder form of G. glabra is commonly used to 
                treat cough, gastric pain, and vomiting tendency, however, the extract of G. glabra L 
                also has healing properties against gastric ulcer lesion, caused by indomethacin and 
                HCl/Ethanol, in a dose-dependent manner. It has been reported that root of G. 
                glabra, also known as licorice or liquorice, derived compounds stimulate the mucus 
                secretion from the stomach, expand the life span of the surface cell of the stomach, 
                and enhance the prostaglandin level which eventually lead to ulcer healing. 
                According to recent studies, the most important bioactive compounds in licorice are 
                flavonoids, triterpenes, and polysaccharides. Glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive 
                compound of G. glabra, is effective against inflammation and ulcers. This triterpenoid 
                saponin-based compound has two isomers such as 18 -GL & 18 -GL and they have 
                anti-fibrogenic properties. Due to the probable antioxidant effect, extracts of licorice 
                had a healing capacity in gastrointestinal ulceration. In the early 1960s, a succinate 
                derivative of glycerrhetinic acid called carbenoxolone was developed in London as 
                an antiulcer drug and was used to assist in the healing of ulcers as the preferred 
                form of licorice. It is determined that G. glabra can increase superoxide dismutase 
                effectively as an enzymatic defense system to treat ulcerative colitis induced by 
                acetic acid.</p>

			<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Licorice root can be effective in treating and preventing peptic ulcers by inhibiting the growth of Helicobacter pylori bacteria, which are often responsible for ulcer formation.</li>
				<li>It has hepatoprotective properties, meaning it can help protect the liver from damage caused by toxins and diseases such as hepatitis.</li>
				<li>It can be used in preventing dental cavities and gum disease due to its antibacterial properties. Licorice root extract is sometimes used in oral health products.</li>
