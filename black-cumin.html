			<h2>Scientic name : Nigella sativa </h2> 
			<p> Belongs to Ranunculaceae family known as black cumin or kalonji, which is used as 
        a spice in many cuisine. Its seed has been used to make medicine for thousands of 
        year. Black seed might have effects in the body that help boost the immune system, 
        fight cancer, prevent pregnancy, reduce swelling, and lessen allergic reactions by 
        acting as an antihistamine. People commonly use black seed for asthma, hay fever, 
        diabetes, high blood pressure, eczema, weight loss, menstrual cramps, and many 
        other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these 
        uses. There is also no good evidence to support using black seed for COVID-19.</p>
