      </h2> 
			<p>M. charantia is a climbing plant of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is often called ‘bitter gourd’ worldwide and as 
        ‘corolla’ in Bangladesh.Powder prepared from the whole plant is locally used in treating diversied ulcers.
        The local people use the unripe fruits as vegetables and cook them. The highest percentage of 
        gastric ulcer inhibition was shown to be 62.85% in the ethanol-induced ulcer model at a dose of 100 mg/kg 
        compared to the standard ranitidine . There was signi cant healing activity with this plant extract to treat 
        acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers . The extract successfully reduced the ulcer index and inhibited the 
        development of gastric ulcers in all the experimental ulcer models including indomethacin-induced, pylorusligated, ethanol-induced, cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers, and stress-induced ulcer. </p>
