			<h2>Scientic name : Moringa oleifera </h2> 
			<p>M. oleifera of the Moringaceae family is locally known as ‘shajna’ in Bangladesh and 
        as ‘drum-stick tree’ worldwide. This plant contains active constituents like alkaloids, 
        beta carotene, tannins, beta sitosterol, zeatin, quercetin, flavonoids, kaempferom, 
        protein, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, phenolic acids, natural sugars, phytosterols, 
        saponin, and terpenoids. Quercetin, a flavonoid compound in M. oleifera, showed 
        strong anti-inflammatory activity. The leaf of M. oleifera helps in the treatment of
        ulcers, indigestion, asthma, and sinus pain. The ethanolic root extract significantly 
        decreased ulcer index, total acidity, and enhanced gastric pH at both doses of 350 
        and 500 mg/kg. The extract also has anti-secretory and cytoprotective potentiality. 
        The alcoholic leaf extract also resulted in the reduction of acid pepsin secretion and 
        ulcer lesion. The acetone, methanol, chloroform, and petroleum ether extracts of the 
        leaves and fruits of M. oleifera were investigated on both gastric and duodenal ulcers
        using acetic acid, pylorus ligation, indomethacin, ethanol, and cold-restraint stressinduced gastric ulcer and cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer model. The methanol 
        and acetone extract of the leaves exerted significant gastric antisecretory and gastric 
        cytoprotective effects in pylorus-ligated rats and both ethanol- and indomethacininduced gastric ulcers, respectively. Compared to the insignificant antiulcer effect of 
        fruit, the leaf extract reduced both cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers and the 
        stress-induced gastric ulcers remarkably. </p>
