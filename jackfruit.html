			<h2>Scientic name :  Artocarpus heterophyllus  </h2> 
			<p>heterophyllus Lam. from the Moraceae family is locally called ‘kanthal’. The leaf ash 
        is taken orally to treat ulcers and young leaves in combination with roots are often 
        beneficial for skin problems, respiratory diseases, and diarrhea (oral medication). 
        The methanolic extract of A. heterophyllus at a concentration of 500 mg/kg inhibited 
        the indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration, decreased gastric acid concentration, 
        and increased gastric pH concentration. In another experiment, the natural phenolic 
        compound Moracin-C (molecular formula: C19H18O4) (Figure 1) was isolated from 
        A. heterophyllus, and has been proven to have considerable anti-inflammatory 
        effects by blocking the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activated nitric oxide 
        (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) without showing detectable cytotoxicity 
        [106]. Moreover, the compound Moracin-C signifi-cantly decreased LPS-stimulated 
        mRNA up-regulation and protein expression of inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 
        nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and several pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, 
        and TNF- ). </p>

			<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
				<li>Vitamin C in jackfruit protects the skin from damage caused by aging and sun exposure. It also plays a crucial role in collagen production, which gives firmness and strength to the skin.</li>
				<li>Jackfruit contains potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and counteracts the effects of sodium, reducing the risk of heart disease, strokes, and bone loss. Additionally, vitamin B6 in jackfruit helps lower homocysteine levels, further supporting heart health.</li>
				<li>Phytonutrients like lignans, isoflavones, and saponins found in jackfruit contribute to its anticancer properties. Studies suggest that jackfruit may help prevent the formation of cancer cells and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.
        </li>
        <li>Jackfruit is rich in minerals such as magnesium, which aids in calcium absorption and strengthens bones, helping prevent bone-related disorders like osteoporosis.
        </li>
        <li>Jackfruit may help regulate blood sugar levels due to its high fiber content and low glycemic index. This can be beneficial for individuals with diabetes or those at risk of developing the condition.
        </li>
        <li>Niacin present in jackfruit is essential for energy metabolism, nerve function, and hormone synthesis, supporting overall metabolic health.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>By regulating blood pressure, lowering cholesterol levels, and reducing inflammation, jackfruit helps prevent heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and strokes.</li>
				<li>The phytonutrients and antioxidants in jackfruit may help prevent cancer by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.
        </li>
				<li>Jackfruit's fiber content and low glycemic index make it a suitable option for individuals with diabetes or those at risk of developing the condition, helping regulate blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li>The dietary fiber in jackfruit promotes digestive health, prevents constipation, and protects against colon cancer by binding to carcinogens in the colon.
        </li>
        <li>Vitamin C in jackfruit protects the skin from damage caused by UV radiation and promotes collagen production, reducing the signs of aging such as wrinkles and sagging skin.</li>
