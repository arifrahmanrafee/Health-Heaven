			<h2>Scientic name :  Lagenaria siceraria
      </h2> 
			<p>L. siceraria of the Cucurbitaceae family is commonly known as ‘bottle gourd’. The 
        fruits, leaves, roots, and seeds of L. siceraria contain different active constituents 
        such as vitamin B, amino acids, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The leaves are 
        cooked and taken by women as a potherb and to relieve the pain during 
        menstruation. The syrups from the fruits are also used to treat bronchial 
        abnormalities like pectoral cough, asthma, etc. The extract of L. siceraria has both 
        strong anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities, though the molecular mechanisms of both 
        anti-ulcer and anti-oxidant activities were not investigated. However, the doses of 
        250 and 400 mg/kg were safe as there was no indications of signs of toxicity or 
        mortality. From another study, a dose up to 1000 mg/kg could be safe after the 
        repeated administration of methanolic extract of L. siceraria fruit for 28 days.
