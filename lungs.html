            <h1>Lung</h1>
            <p>
              Your lungs make up a large part of your respiratory system, which
              is the network of organs and tissues that allow you to breathe.
              You have two lungs, one on each side of your chest, which is also
              called the thorax. Your thorax is the area of your body between
              your neck and your abdomen.
            </p>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Lung disease refers to several types of diseases or disorders that
              prevent the lungs from functioning properly. Lung disease can
              affect respiratory function, or the ability to breathe, and
              pulmonary function, which is how well lungs work. There are many
              different lung diseases, some of which are caused by bacterial,
              viral, or fungal infections. Other lung diseases are associated
              with environmental factors, including asthma, mesothelioma, and
              lung cancer.
