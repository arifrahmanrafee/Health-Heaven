			<h2>Scientic name : Beta vulgaris </h2> 
			<p>vulgaris of the Chenopodiaceae family is generally referred to as ‘beetroot’ or ‘sugar 
        beet’, widely used as a vegetable or as a salad .The root decoction along with a 
        small amount of vinegar is traditionally used for the treatment of ulcers and sores. 
        The alcoholic root extract of B. vulgaris at a concentration of 200–400 mg/kg 
        significantly decreased the ulcer index, ulcer score, total acidity, and maintains 
        normal mucosa in pylorus ligation and ethanol-induced ulcer in rat models. The 
        active constituents in B. vulgaris are polyphenols, tannins, alkaloids, vitamins (e.g., 
        C, B3, B6, B9), carotenoids, flavonoids, betacyanins, betaxanthins, betanin, and 
        saponins, most likely have inhibitory effects on gastric mucosal injury. Betalains 
        (molecular formula: C24H26N2O13) (Figure 1), nitrogenous water-soluble 
        compounds, are abundant in B. vulgaris which have strong therapeutic activity 
        against inflammatory diseases. This phenolic chromoalkaloid synthesized from the 
        amino acid tyrosine is used as food additives due to its high solubility and lack of 
        toxicity. Pre-treatment with petroleum ether extract of B. vulgaris L. gave significant 
        defense against aspirin-induced gastric ulcers. The anti-ulcer effects are likely due to 
        the existence of steroids or phenols in the extract. Moreover, there are significant 
        anti-inflammatory properties in the aqueous extract of B. vulgaris which was also 
        investigated against the carrageenan-induced edema in rats. </p>

			<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which are converted into nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide helps relax and dilate blood vessels, improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure.</li>
				<li>By helping to lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation, beetroot can contribute to overall heart health. Its high levels of folate also play a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
				<li>Beetroot can support liver function by aiding in the detoxification process. The betaine in beets helps the liver process fats and prevents the accumulation of fatty deposits.</li>
				<li>The fiber content in beetroot supports healthy digestion by promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. It also supports a healthy gut microbiome.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The betalains and other antioxidants in beetroot have been shown to have anti-cancer properties. They help reduce the growth of cancer cells and protect against oxidative damage that can lead to cancer.
        </li>
				<li>The nitrates in beetroot improve blood flow to the brain, which can enhance cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases.</li>
				<li>Beetroot is rich in vitamin C, which is essential for a healthy immune system. It helps in the production of white blood cells and enhances the body’s ability to fight infections.</li>
