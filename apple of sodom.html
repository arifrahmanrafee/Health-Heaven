			<h2>Scientic name : Calotropis procera</h2> 
			<p> C. procera of the Asclepiadaecae family is popularly termed ‘akanda’ in Bangladesh 
        and ‘milkweed’ worldwide. The leaf, flower, flower bud, latex, root bark, and root of 
        this plant contain different bioactive compounds such as triterpenoids, lupeol, 
        flavonoids, flavanols, glycosides, resins, cardenolides, mudarine, anthocyanins, -
        amyrin, amyrin, calactin, calotropin, and -sitosterol. Bioactive compounds from C. 
        procera show protective properties against different diseases. Traditionally, the latex 
        is used in reducing toothache, in the treatment of vertigo, paralysis, hair loss, 
        baldness, and rheumatoid/joint swellings. In addition, the leaves have therapeutic 
        values to reduce swelling as well as to treat joint pain. The bark is used in the 
        treatment of eczema, leprosy, and elephantiasis treatment.
