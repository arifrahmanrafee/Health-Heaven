			<h2>Scientic name :  Calendula officinalis </h2> 
			<p>C. officinalis L. (family: Asteraceae) is popular with the name ‘gada ful’ to 
        Bangladeshi people. The petals are orally administered in the treatment of stomach 
        pain, inflammation, and ulcers. The extract of C. officinalis had both antacid property 
        and gastroprotective capacity. Significant gastro-curative efficacy of the extract was 
        investigated against absolute ethanol and indomethacin induced ulcerative lesion in 
        rats. Another study also confirmed the presence of gastroprotective properties in the 
        plant extract of C. officinalis resulting in the substantial inhibition of the ulcer 
        development caused by chemical and physical agents with 87.15% utmost 
        therapeutic efficiency (450 mg/kg bwt) in cold-resistant and stress-induced ulcers.
