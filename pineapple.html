			<h2>Scientic name : Ananas comosus  </h2> 
			<p>Bromelain belongs to a group of protein digesting enzymes obtained commercially from the fruit or stem of pineapple. Fruit bromelain and stem bromelainare prepared differently and they contain different enzymatic composition. “Bromelain” refers usually to the “stem bromelain.” Bromelain is a mixture of different thiol endopeptidases and other components like phosphatase, glucosidase, peroxidase, cellulase, escharase, and several protease inhibitors. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that bromelain exhibits various fibrinolytic, antiedematous, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Bromelain is considerably absorbable in the body without losing its proteolytic activity and without producing any major side effects. Bromelain accounts for many therapeutic benefits like the treatment of angina pectoris, bronchitis, sinusitis, surgical trauma, and thrombophlebitis, debridement of wounds, and enhanced absorption of drugs, particularly antibiotics. It also relieves osteoarthritis, diarrhea, and various cardiovascular disorders. Bromelain also possesses some anticancerous activities and promotes apoptotic cell death. This paper reviews the important properties and therapeutic applications of bromelain, along with the possible mode of action. </p>

			<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Pineapple is a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin B6, folate, manganese, and potassium. These nutrients support various bodily functions and overall health.</li>
				<li>The high vitamin C content in pineapple boosts the immune system, helping the body fight off infections and illnesses.</li>
				<li>Vitamin C in pineapple promotes collagen production, which is essential for skin elasticity and strength. This can help reduce the signs of aging and improve overall skin health.</li>
				<li>Pineapple contains manganese, a mineral important for bone formation and health. Adequate intake of manganese can help prevent bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis.</li>
        <li>Pineapple is low in calories and high in water content, making it a filling snack that can help with weight management. The fiber content also promotes satiety, reducing overall calorie intake.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Pineapple's potassium content helps regulate blood pressure and reduce the risk of hypertension, a major risk factor for heart disease. The antioxidants in pineapple also help prevent oxidative damage to the heart and blood vessels.
        </li>
				<li>Pineapple, when consumed in moderation, can be a part of a diabetes-friendly diet. Its fiber content helps regulate blood sugar levels, although it should be consumed mindfully due to its natural sugar content.</li>
				<li>The antioxidants and bromelain in pineapple have been studied for their potential to reduce the risk of certain types of cancer by preventing oxidative damage and inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.
