			<h2>Scientic name :  Camellia sinensis</h2> 
			<p>C. sinensis of the Theaceae family is locally termed as ‘cha’ in Bangladesh and as 
        ‘black tea’ worldwide. The leaves, stems, and twigs contain different active 
        constituents like flavonoids (e.g., thearubigins, theaflavins, and catechins), vitamins 
        amino acids,carotene, chlorogenic acids, volatile compounds carbohydrates, 
        phenolic acids (e.g., gallic acid, caffeic acid, and cauramic acid), proteins, lipids, and 
        fluoride. These components help in the treatment of different diseases with 
        their different protective properties. This plant is traditionally used in the treatment of 
        flatulence, digestion, vomiting, diarrhea, maintaining body temperature, blood sugar, 
        and in the alleviation of stomach discomfort. Heteropolysaccharides 
        extracted from C. sinensis exerted gastroprotective properties by reducing ethanolinduced gastric lesions. Moreover, it was also found effective in gastroprotection by 
        gastric mucus maintenance and decreased glutathione levels. </p>
