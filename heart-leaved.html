			<h2>Scientic name : Tinospora cordifolia </h2> 
			<p>T. cordifolia (family: Menispermaceae), locally known as ‘pipolti’, is traditionally used 
                as a treatment for gastric trouble and ulcers. Moreover, the anti-ulcer efficiency of T. 
                cordifolia extracts was assessed in ethanol and the pylorus ligation-induced ulcer 
                model whereas a remarkable reduction of ulcer index, gastric volume, and total 
                acidity sup-ported the efficacy of the extract as an anti-ulcer agent. The major 
                phytocomponents which were isolated from the T. cordifolia, sesquiterpene 
                tinocordifolin, tinocordifolioside, sesquiterpene glycoside, arabinogalactan, 
                tinocordiside, makisterone, magnoflorine, and palmatine could play a vital role in 
                reducing the illness. </p>
