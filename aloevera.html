			<h2>Scientic name : Aloe vera (L.) </h2> 
			<p>A. vera from Liliaceae is known as ‘ghritkumari’ in Bangladesh and India, and ‘Aloe vera’ 
        worldwide. The leaves, mainly, of A. vera have great medicinal importance as they have 
        active chemical compounds such as saponins, essential amino acids (e.g., cysteine, alanin, 
        arginine, and histidine); anthraquinones (e.g., aloetic acid, aloin A and B (or collec-tively 
        known as barbaloin), anthracine, anthranon, emodin, etc.); enzymes (e.g., alkaline 
        phosphotase, amylase, catalase, cellulase, cyclooxidase, and lipase); hormones (e.g., auxin 
        and gibberllins); chromones, lignin, minerals, salicylic acid, sterols, carbohydrates (e.g., 
        lignins and sugars); dietary bers, protein, organic acids, lipids, and vitamins. For the 
        treatment of ulcers, rural people take the inner gel layer of eshy leaves orally with water.
        This plant has great potential for curing and preventing gastric ulcers by stimulating its 
        anti-in ammatory and healing function and by regulating the mucus and gastric secre-tion 
        vera can successfully treat various illnesses and conditions including duodenal 
        ulcers, peptic ulcers, mouth ulcers, and sore throats. A. vera, coupled with silver 
        nanoparticles, was e ective for ulcer healing by their anti-in ammatory enhanced re-epithelialization as well as broblast activation e ects. A. vera extract pre-treated animals 
        (dose of 200 mg/kg bwt for ve days) had reduced signs of mucosal injury relative to 
        untreated controls, although the incidence was not as high as in omeprazole-treated rats.
        On the contrary, A. vera extract pre-treatment was ine ective against gastric lesion 
        formation. Furthermore, the extract of A. vera has been shown to cause dose-dependent amelioration in the severity, as well as incidence, of acetic acid-induced gastric lesions 
        when used as a preventive measure in rats. Aloin A and B (molecular formula: 
        C21H22O9), collectively known as barbaloin (Figure 1), is considered one of the prominent 
        constituents isolated from A. vera which showed potency to treat ulcers and in ammatory 
        diseases. To treat ulcerative colitis, barbaloin e ectively increases the mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-10 in tissues and simultaneously decreases the expression of IFN-γ, IL6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Furthermore, barbaloin can prevent the ulcer-mediated myosin 
        light chain kinase (MLCK) signaling pathway by activating the 5’ adenosine 
        monophosphate-ac-tivated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway.
