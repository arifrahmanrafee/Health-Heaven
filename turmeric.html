			<h2>Scientic name : Curcuma longa L </h2> 
			<p>C. longa L. of the Zingiberaceae family is locally known as ‘halud’ in Bangladesh and India and commonly 
                termed as ‘turmeric’ worldwide. The rhizome and leaves of C. longa contain many active constituents such 
                as alkaloids, phenolic compounds (e.g., iso avone, diarylheptanoids curcuminoids, diyrenphenate), alcohols, 
                essential oils (e.g., monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenoids), ketones, ß-turmerone, αturmerone, steroids (e.g., β-sitosterol), and aldehydes. Traditionally, this plant has been used to cure 
                dermatitis, cancer, leprosy, hemorrhoids, in ammation, and asthma, and shows hepato-pro-tective activity. 
                Based on its antioxidant property, curcumin (molecular formula: C21H20O6) (Figure 1), also known as  
                diferuloylmethane, an active component of C. longa, scavenges ROS and regulates matrix 
                metallopeptidases (MMPs) activity to induce antiulcer activity. Beside this, curcumin also exerted di erent 
                pharmacological e ects including anti-in ammatory activity triggered by suppression of PG synthesis . It is 
                reported that the substitution group on the methoxy position draws a vital contribution in the anti-inammatory e ects of curcumin. In a transgenic mice model, it was shown that phytosomal curcumin exerted 
                strong e ects on the activation of anti-in ammatory PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) as 
                well as the inhibition of pro-in ammatory NF-κB, therefore, it could be used in the treat-ment of patients with 
                chronic hepatitis B infection . The application of the paste of the rhizome is carried out on injuries, strains, 
                and wounds externally as the primary treatment. The leaves are also used in malar-ia and jaundice 
                treatment and during pregnancy. From the ndings of phase-I clinical trials and toxicology studies conducted 
                by Anand et al., it was concluded that curcumin is safe and tolerated even at very high doses (12 g/day) in 
                humans . A joint report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture 
                Organization (FAO) has recommended that a high intake of curcumin at a concentration of 0-1 mg/kg body 
                weight per day had no adverse health e ects on the human body .</p>

			<h2>Health Benefits</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Turmeric has strong antioxidant properties, which help neutralize free radicals and protect cells from oxidative damage. This can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases and support overall health.
                </li>
				<li>The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin can help alleviate pain associated with conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also reduce muscle soreness after exercise.</li>
				<li>Curcumin can cross the blood-brain barrier and has neuroprotective properties. It may help improve cognitive function, reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, and boost mood by increasing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).</li>
				<li>Turmeric supports digestive health by stimulating bile production, which aids in the digestion of fats. It can also help reduce symptoms of indigestion, bloating, and gas.</li>
			</ul>

        <section>
			<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Turmeric supports liver health by enhancing detoxification processes and protecting liver cells from damage. It can help prevent liver diseases and improve liver function.</li>
				<li>Turmeric's anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties make it beneficial for the skin. It can help treat acne, psoriasis, and eczema, and promote wound healing and skin repair.</li>
				<li>The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of turmeric can help alleviate respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</li>
