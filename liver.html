                <h1>Liver</h1>
                <p>The liver is an organ that sits just under the rib cage on the right side of the abdomen. It can weigh up to 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). The liver is needed to help digest food, rid the body of waste products and make substances, called clotting factors, that keep the blood flowing well, among other tasks.</p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Liver disease can be passed through families, called inherited. Anything that damages the liver also can cause liver problems, including viruses, alcohol use and obesity.
                Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition. But early treatment may give the liver time to heal. Liver disease doesn't always cause symptoms that can be seen or felt. If there are symptoms of liver disease, they may include: Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black or brown skin, Belly pain and swelling,Swelling in the legs and ankles, Itchy skin.Dark urine.Pale stool.Constant tiredness,Nausea or vomiting,Loss of appetite,Bruising easily.</p>
