			<h2>Scientic name : Carica papaya </h2> 
			<p>C. papaya of the Caricaceae family is commonly known as ‘papaya’. C. papaya contains diverse 
        active constituents like enzymes (e.g., papain, chemopapain, chymopapain, peptidase, lysosome, and 
        myrosine), proteins, fats (e.g., myristic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic), carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, 
        fructose, galactose, and xylitol), minerals, vitamins, volatile compounds, alkaloids (e.g., carpain, 
        pseudocarpain, choline, and caproside), glycosides, and carotenoids. The most common and 
        signi cant constituent, papain, is a papaya proteinase I (cysteine protease) enzyme which has several 
        therapeutic effects particularly in in ammation and gastrointestinal disorders. Traditionally, the 
        decoctions of leaves and dried owers were used as anti-anemic agents, blood purifiers, and in several 
        diseases. Fruits are used to treat impotence and ulcer. The crude latex decoction is used 
        to treat anthelmintic, dyspepsia, burns pain, bleeding hemorrhoids, stomachic, and diarrhea.
