			<h2>Scientic name : Mimosa pudica </h2> 
			<p>C. asiatica of the Umbelliferae family is locally known as ‘thankunipata’ in Bangladesh and as ‘Indian pennywort’ worldwide. It originates from the wetlands of Asia . The paste of the leaves of C. asiatica is locally
        used for ulcers and different gastric disorders. Traditionally, this plant has been used to treat diarrhea,
        rheumatism, skin diseases, syphilis, and in ammation. Several main components i.e., madecassoside,
        madecassic acid, asiaticoside, and asiatic acid, present in C. asiatica were extensively studied for therapeutic purposes including ulcers and in ammatory diseases. Asiaticoside (molecular formula: C48H78O19)
        (Figure 1), a major active constituent of C. asiatica, plays an important role in healing gastric ulcers. Asiaticoside is a glycoside compound that belongs to the triterpenoid group. Acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers
        in rats were reduced with a lower lesion score, minimized ulcer size, and reduced or absent leucocytes
        in ltration and submucosal edema, when the plant extract was administered orally. Rats pre-treated with
        leaf extract exhibited comparatively better protection of the gastric mucosa.</p>
